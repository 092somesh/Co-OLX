#Co-OLX 
A portal for student of NITT where they can interact and sell/donate their stuff which are of no longer use to them.

Only by giving are you able to receive more than you have.

Every year when senior leave the campus, they have a lot of stuff which are of no use to them like books, cycle, electric appliances, etc.
So, we provide a portal for them where they can upload such items on the site and can sell/donate to their fellow juniors from other department as well. 
This will encourage the reusability of stuff and lessen the wastage.
